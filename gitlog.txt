    Final tests passed
    
    Final two tests tested functionality of dealing, relating to how many cards were remaining after dealing and with what the solution set should contain. All tests have thus been created as per the requirements, and all pass, so code is functional.

    Third test created and passed
    
    I rewrote the test functionality for checking on card initialization to better fit the flow of the code. cards are an ArrayList in the Board class, may refactor to have separate card lists.

    Started on Clue Players 1
    
    I instantiated all classes, but only added barely any functionality to Player.java. Created the first test, testLoadPeople(), which currently runs but fails (tested functionality isn't finished). This is just a starting point.

    refactor #7
    
    makeadjlist() was also doing too much in one function so we split it into a smaller function with several helper functions taking care of building specific adjacencies

    refactor 4
    
    refactored the code logic to create variables at the start of functions so we only called the getters and setters once per function making code easier to read and more efficient

    All tests have been passed, both individually and concurrently. Code needed only minor modification; slightly reworked tests to better match our excel board, and secretpassage test saw the use of a if statement in Board class. IMPORTANT: All tests have passed, but assignment still needs slight alteration. Still need to do a the git diff part and refactor the code.

    Both of us were working on this project together, pair programming style, for this final commit. We were able to resolve several vestigial bugs in the code, cleaning the last 4 test cases, in addition to finishing the calcTargets() method. Certification is as follows:I, Tristan Karno, certify that I participated equitably in the creation of assignment C13A-2, dated 3/3/25.
    I, Michael Hargraves, certify that I participated equitably in the creation of this assignment C13A-2, dated 3/3/25.

    nevermind the arraylist of arraylists idea. As long as board size initialization happens in its home class, there's no need for dynamic sizing. Also: I modified the code involvng the TestBoard, and now the first 4 classes pass. The two methods unfinished as before still need to be completed.

    A few things. First: I modified both classes 'TestBoard' and 'TestBoardCell', now 'TestBoardCell' has all methods defined. 'TestBoard' still needs 'calcTargets' and 'getTargets'. I would also require us to change 'TestBoardCell[][] board' to 'List<List<TestBoardCell>> board' for easier dynamic allocation of the board size outside of its constructor. Besides this, most work needs to be done in 'calcTargets', and when these tasks are complete, this assignment is complete.
